# Convolutional Neural Network for Galaxy Cluster Mass Prediction

This project involves the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict galaxy cluster masses. The data comes from simulations of eROSITA observations, specifically from the Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS).

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `data_augment_CNN.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook related to data augmentation in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- `our_best_CNN.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project's best CNN model.
- `naive_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing a simpler or baseline model.
- `hyperparam_tuning.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook related to hyperparameter tuning of models.
- `redshift_CNN.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook related to a CNN model dealing with redshifts.
- `models/`: Directory containing trained models.
- `output_data/`: Directory containing output data from the project, possibly predictions or processed data.
- `requirements.txt`: File containing a list of Python packages required to run the project.

## Installation

To set up the project, first clone the repository. Then, install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the notebooks, use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Or:

```
jupyter lab
```

Then navigate to the desired notebook and run the cells.
